Hello

I am Madhav Kumar, pursuing my bachelor degree in Computer Science and Engineering from Lovely Professional University.

This is my backend project developed in Java using Spring Boot. The primary goal of the project is to fetch details such as the opening and closing prices of stocks in the market.

In my project, I have following Folders:

Model Folder: This folder contains data files with private variables such as stockName, openPrice, and closePrice.
Controller Folder: This folder includes a controller file used for handling get and post requests. In the @PostMapping method, we provide the stock name, and in the @GetMapping method, we retrieve and display the stock details via a function call. If the stock name is not provided, it will print null.
Service Folder: Contains two files: StockApiResponse and StockService. In the StockService file, we construct a URL string using a base URL, query parameters, and an API key. We then use RestTemplate to make an HTTP GET request and store the response in a list of generic type, which holds the opening and closing prices.
The dependencies used in the project include:

Lombok: To reduce code size by generating getters, setters, constructors, etc.
Spring Web: For connecting to the server.
To make the project run smoothly, I have used the Postman extension.

How to use it:

We have to create a new http request.
Select the post method.
Click on the body tab, choose raw data, and set the type to json.
Enter the stock name in json format and send the request.
After successfully sending the post request, proceed with the get request.
Thank you.
